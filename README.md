## Description
To run the Minesweeper application, open the terminal to where the files are located and run the main.py file. This should open the Minesweeper GUI. The terminal will notify the user what row and column was last clicked as well as the total number of squares the user has uncovered. The terminal will notify the user if they have uncovered all of the squares successfully and won the game or if they clicked a square with a mine. After notifying the user, the game will restart.

## Project Status
This project is mostly complete with the lack of some features. One feature that was planned to be added was to change the color of the clicked mine square to a different color before the game resets, however this could not be implemented due to time constraints. Another feature that was planned to be added was to reveal adjacent squares of the clicked square until a square with an adjacent mine has been reached.
